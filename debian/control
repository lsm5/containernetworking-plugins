Description: Libraries for writing CNI plugins
 The CNI (Container Network Interface) project consists of a specification
 and libraries for writing plugins to configure network interfaces in Linux
 containers, along with a number of supported plugins. CNI concerns itself
 only with network connectivity of containers and removing allocated resources
 when the container is deleted.
